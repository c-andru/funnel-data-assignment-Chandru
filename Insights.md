# Insights Report

## Actionable Insights
- Mobile drop-off is highest between Interact → Clicks. Merchants should consider adding clearer CTAs, faster-loading product images, or predictive search on mobile.  
- Desktop has better overall funnel retention, meaning checkout flow is smoother there. Optimize mobile checkout to match desktop ease.  
- Unknown intent accounts for a notable share of messages. Improve chatbot NLP to reduce ambiguity and capture clearer buying signals.  
- Top intents related to "product availability" and "pricing" correlate with purchase. Merchants should surface stock/ETA and discounts earlier.  

## Suggested Experiment
